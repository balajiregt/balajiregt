👋 Hi, I’m @balaji
👀 I’m interested in aquiring knowledge and best approaches in test automation.
I am proficient in low code test automation tools and its implementations (TestProject.io, Katalon Studio, AccelQ, Testim etc).
🌱 Continuously improving my automation framework knowledge in "Cypress.IO- Mocha" and "Selenium WebDriver".
🌱 Not an expert but trying to know how on concepts in Java and Javascript.
🌱 Having a good understand of Rest API's and can perform API automation using Postman, Rest Assured lib, Cypress.io.
💞️ This repository is just my practice repository to showcase my test automation knowledge and expertise.
"Cypress_Practice" repo is having sample projects- using different frameworks like BDD, Data Driven, POM, API testing, BDD assertions (expect/should), Chai-jQuery assertions
